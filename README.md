# Forage_PWC_Call_Center

  In today's rapidly evolving world, the need for a skills revolution is more critical than ever. It's not just about digital skills; it's about empowering individuals with a 
  broad range of abilities like digital awareness, emotional intelligence, and creativity. These skills are essential for thriving in the digital workplace of the future.
  
  At PwC, we recognize this need and are actively working with organizations worldwide to address it. We've made significant strides in upskilling our 276,000 employees, but 
  we believe more needs to be done to ensure that everyone can learn, work, and engage in the digital world. This commitment is central to our purpose.
  
  To further this mission, we have introduced the concept of "Digital Accelerators." These are employees who are eager to advance their skills rapidly in key digital areas. 
  Through our "career pivot" initiative, these motivated individuals can specialize in fields such as data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and digital 
  storytelling. We provide them with the opportunity to learn various self-service tools and coding languages, which they then apply across our business operations.
  
  By fostering an environment of continuous learning and development, we aim to empower our workforce and equip them with the skills necessary for the digital age. Our goal is 
  to ensure that every employee has the chance to grow and succeed in the ever-changing digital landscape, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to our organization and 
  society at large.
